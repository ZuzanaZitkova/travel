                <h4>Noir cafe</h4>
                <p>
                  Nice small cafe very close to Notre Dame. Noir roasts its
                  coffees in its workshop located in the heart of the Saint-Ouen
                  Flea Market, at the gates of Paris. Noir selects micro-lots
                  from the best Arabica in the world, grown ethically and
                  fairly.

                <h5>Adress</h5>
                <p>63 Rue Saint-Louis en l'Île, 75004 Paris, France</p>
                <h4>What do I like about it?</h4>
                <p>
                  Amazing, delicious coffee in the centre of Paris. Even the
                  cafe is so close to many well known monuments, it is not
                  always crouded and you luckily find a place to sit and enjoy
                  your cup of deliciousness. Fall in love with this place
                  especially when I found the underground peaceful area,
                  absolutely made for your little morning reading.
